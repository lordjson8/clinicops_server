# This file tells Railway HOW to build and run your app.
# Railway reads this automatically from your repo root.
#
# NOTE: Health check is configured per-service in the Railway dashboard,
# NOT here — because this file applies to ALL services (web, celery, beat),
# and only the web service can respond to HTTP health checks.
